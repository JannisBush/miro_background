# Installation

## Requirements
- MiRo robot (real or sim, not everything will work with a simulated MiRo)
- ROS Kinetic
- MDK 180509
- my version of image_recognition Branch MiRo [git](https://github.com/JannisBush/image_recognition/tree/miro)
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src` and `git clone https://github.com/JannisBush/image_recognition.git` and `cd ..` and `catkin_make`
	- optional:
		- to use some of the subsystems you need to install additional packages
		- follow the installation instructions there: e.g. for tensorflow_ros `sudo apt-get install tensorflow`
		- optional: train with new images to recognize your objects
- my version of ros_posenet  [git](https://github.com/JannisBush/ros_posenet)
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`  and `git clone https://github.com/JannisBush/ros_posenet.git` and `cd ..` and `catkin_make`
	- if NodeJS8.X is not installed `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -` and `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ros_posenet/` and `npm install`
- my version of teleop_twist_keyboard [git](https://github.com/JannisBush/teleop_twist_keyboard_MiRo)
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`  and `git clone https://github.com/JannisBush/teleop_twist_keyboard_MiRo.git` and `cd ..` and `catkin_make`
- this repository
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src`  and `git clone https://github.com/JannisBush/teleop_twist_keyboard_MiRo.git` and `cd ..` and `catkin_make`
	- now you should be able to run all of the appli
- **Optional:**
- my version of face_detection (changes in config, + compatible with OpenCV3 instead of 2) [git](https://github.com/JannisBush/face_detection)
	- if you have not yet installed/downloaded dlib, download it [here](http://dlib.net)
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws/src` and `git clone https://github.com/JannisBush/face_detection.git`
	- change the path in line 131 of CMakeLists.txt to where you downloaded dlib
	- `cd ~/catkin_ws` and `catkin_make`
- my version of features_face including OpenFace [git](https://github.com/JannisBush/features_face)
	- TODO: create installation instructions
	- additional: change a lot of paths etc.

## Scripts (run using roslaunch or rosrun)
- miro_background
	- roslaunch:
		- real_monitor.launch: main application including monitoring and reaction to touch, sound (primitive analysis), poses (posenet), emotions (OpenFace), horizontal faces (dlib), objects (tensorflow/inception)
			- miro_background/monitor_all.py
			- miro_background/face_safety and face_detection/face_detection_dlib
			- miro_background/recognize_objects.py and image_recognition/tensorflow_ros/object_recognition_node
			- 2x image_transport/republish
			- ros_posenet/posenet.js
			- miro_background/miro_camera.py and feature_faces/exectuable_launcher.py (OpenFace)
		- real_camaera.launch: old version of emotion recognition standalone
			- miro_background/openface_listener.py 
			- miro_background/miro_camera.py
			- feature_faces/exectuable_launcher.py (OpenFace)
			- 1x image_transport/republish
			- image_view/image_view
			- additional: use check_actions.sh or check_emotions.sh to control the output
		- real.launch: old idea of some background safety nodes including teleop
			- miro_background/miro_teleop.py
			- miro_background/sensor_to_pos.py
			- miro_background/face_safety.py and face_detection/face_detection_dlib
			- miro_background/background_safety.py
			- 1x image_transport/republish
		- sim.launch: old version of real.launch with the simulated MiRo
	- (Standalone) rosrun:
		- (robot=sim01|rob01) miro_teleop.py: receiver node for teleoperation (needs publisher node teleop_twist_keyboard/teleop_twist_keyboard.py)
		- (monitor.py and monitor_all.py: old versions of monitor_all.py used in real_monitor.launch)
		- (only real) audio_display.py: displays the audio signal and has some ideas for primative sound analysis
		- (only real) platform_control_server.py and control_test.py: ideas and test for using services instead of publisher/subscriber (topics)
		- (only real) recognize_objects.py and tensorflow_ros/object_recognition_node: categorizes the toys
		- (robot=sim01|rob01) sensor_to_pos.py: publishes odometry and tf of MiRo (used to try maps + visualization in rviz)
		- (robot=sim01|rob01) recorded_sounds_random_lights.py: can play back all the prepacked sounds on MiRo's P1 and P2 and also has an random light generator
			- send `rostopic pub /soundP[12] std_msgs/Int8 1` to start a loop over all available P1 or P2 sound messages, with the bug at the end
			- send `rostopic pub /soundP3 std_msgs/Int8 <Number>` to play the sound `Number` on P3 (default Number between 1-5)
			- send `rostopic pub -r <hz> /lights String a` to let the robot randomly flash it's leds `<hz>` times per second
		- (robot=sim01|rob01 follow_type=mics|core), sound_follow_1_2.py: two options of following a sound source, one using the spatial interface the other using just the crosscorrelation between the two microphones (used in real_monitor.launch/monitor_all.py)
- ros_posenet
	- roslaunch:
		- posenet.launch: Starts pose analysis (change robot in the launchfile)
			- ros_posenet/posenet.js 
			- image_transport/republish
	- rosrun:
		- display_keypoints.py: displays the keypoints (skeleton), can be used with posenet.launch or real_monitor.launch
- teleop_twist_keyboard
	- rosrun:
		- teleop_twist_keyboard: sends commands to move MiRo's base and MiRo's head
- image_recognition (everything uses rosrun)
	- image_recognition_rqt
		- folder_image_publisher: you can use it to publish some images to ROS
		- annotation_gui: to annotate objects
		- test_gui: to test the recognition of the objects
	- tensorflow_ros (needs tensorflow installed)
		- `retrain [iamge_folder] [model_folder_inceptionv3] [output_dir]`: to train the classifier on the annotated images/objects
		- `object_recognition_node _graph_path:=<path_to_graph.pb> _labels_path:=<path_to_labels.txt>`: to start the recognition service
		- for other uses see the original github repo
	- Face recognition (needs openface -not OpenFace- installed)
		- face_recognition_node: to train on faces and start the recognition service
	- keras_ros (age/gender estimation) (needs keras installed)
		- `face_properties_node _weights_file_path:=<path_to_model>`: to start the recognition service
	- for more uses (pose recognition, skybiometry) look at the original repo
- face_detection and features_faces


**Other Interesting software:**
- ORB_SLAM2_ROS
- ratslam_ros (did not work with Miro?)
- RASL-MIRO (add closing parenthesis in flags.py, make mic_test.py easier, commented out import of sound interface in sound_test.py)
- miroDetection (changes in miroDetectorROS.py to make it work, e.g. add rospy.spin())
- Miro_SocialRobot (no changes)
- MiRo-follow.paralel.line.in.motion (no changes)
- Miro (no changes)
- ActiveHearing_onMiro (only change IP address in client.py)
- Kate etc.
- my other (first) scripts?
